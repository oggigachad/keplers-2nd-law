🌌 Kepler's Second Law Simulation 🚀
This project is an interactive visualization of 🌍 Kepler's Second Law of Planetary Motion using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates how a planet orbits a star (the sun) and sweeps out equal areas in equal time intervals! 🪐✨

📖 Description
Kepler's Second Law states:

"A planet moves faster when it is closer to the sun and slower when it is farther away, sweeping out equal areas in equal times." 🌞

Key Concepts:

🌀 Faster Motion Near the Sun: At periapsis (closest to the sun), the planet moves faster.
🐢 Slower Motion Farther Away: At apoapsis (farthest from the sun), the planet slows down.
This simulation includes:

🌠 Elliptical Orbit: A planet moves around a sun positioned at one focus of the ellipse.
🎛️ Interactive Controls: Modify speed and eccentricity to see how the orbit changes!
📊 Real-Time Chart: Visualize the swept area with a dynamic bar chart.
🌟 Features
🖼️ Canvas Visualization: Watch the planet orbit the sun dynamically.
⚙️ Interactive Controls:
Speed Slider: Adjust the orbital speed.
Eccentricity Slider: Change the shape of the orbit (circle → ellipse).
Pause/Reset Buttons: Control the animation easily.
📏 Dynamic Calculations:
Real-time angular sweep and area covered display.
Accurate adherence to Kepler's Second Law.
📊 Bar Chart: Visualize the swept area over four orbital divisions using Chart.js.
🛠️ Technologies Used
🌐 HTML5: For building the structure of the simulation.
🎨 CSS3: For clean and responsive styling.
📜 JavaScript: For animations, orbit calculations, and interactivity.
📊 Chart.js: To display the swept area dynamically.
🚀 How to Use
Start the Simulation:
Watch the planet orbiting the sun while following Kepler's Second Law.
Adjust Parameters:
Use sliders to change speed and eccentricity.
Pause/Reset:
Pause or reset the orbit for exploration.
Explore the Data:
Observe how the angular sweep and swept area change in real-time.
🎉 Experience Kepler’s Second Law in action! 🚀
